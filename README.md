## The PersonaForge Prompt

The prompt is in the PersonaForge Prompt directory.

It's a markdown file (basically Plain Text) pretty much all text editors should be able to open it. 

You can copy it straight into ChatGPT 4 and away you go.

Note on ChatGPT 3.5 - It seems to be struggling with superprompts like this recently. It can do it, you just have to work with ChatGPT more and often correct itfor rushing ahead.

If you figure out a version for 3.5 I would love to see it

## Why GitHub?

Despite it's terrifying setup for the non-programmer. GitHub provides important tools for helping people collaborate on code.

Even if that code is a written document, or in our case here, a prompt designed for ChatGPT 4.

Rather than me explain GitHub and it’s weirdness, I asked ChatGPT to explain GitHub to me like I’m a 10 year old.

### ChatGPT Explains Github To me like I'm a 10 year old.

Of course! Let's break it down:

1. **Make an Account**: Like signing up for a new game, you need to create a GitHub account. Go to github.com and sign up. 

2. **Create a New Repository**: This is like starting a new game in Minecraft. Each game (or repository) has its own unique world (or code). On the GitHub website, click the "+", and then "New repository". You'll need to give it a name. You can think of this like naming your new game world.

3. **Upload Your Code**: This is like putting your Lego creations in your new game world. In your new repository, click "Add file" and then "Upload files". You can then choose the files from your computer to upload.

4. **Commit Your Code**: This is like saving your game. You'll need to write a short message about what you did (like "Added my super prompt code"), and then click "Commit changes".

5. **Sharing Your Code**: Now your game world is public! You can share the URL of your repository with other people. It's like giving your friends the address of your Minecraft server. 

6. **Improvements**: Other people can suggest changes to your code. This is like if your friends visit your Minecraft world and suggest where to put more trees or what to build next. In GitHub, this is done through something called a "pull request". 

7. **Pull Requests**: If your friend suggests a change and you like it, you can add it to your world. On GitHub, if someone makes a "pull request" (a suggestion to change the code), you can review it and if you like it, click "Merge pull request" to add their changes to your code. 

Remember, like playing a game, it might seem confusing at first, but the more you use it, the easier it gets. Happy coding!

### What The Fork?

The other confusing thing is the whole concept of "Forking".

Let's get ChatGPT to explain this.

Great question! 

Forking a repository in GitHub is like making a copy of someone else's Minecraft world to play in it yourself. 

Let's say you visit a friend's world and think it's really cool. You want to add your own stuff without changing your friend's original world. So you make a copy of their world, and in this copied world, you can build, add, or remove anything you want. 

In GitHub, if you find a repository (or game world) you like, you can "fork" it, which creates a copy of that repository in your own GitHub account. In this forked repository, you can make all the changes you want without affecting the original repository. If you make changes that you think could improve the original repository, you can suggest those changes to the original owner with a "pull request". This is like saying to your friend, "Hey, I made some cool changes in my copy of your world, do you want to add them to your original world?" 

Remember, the goal is always to learn, have fun, and maybe build something cool!

As you can see - Forking and then making Pull requests are a way of making contributions to our prompts while being able to keep track of all the changes so we can learn together as we evolve our prompts.

## Let's discuss!

There is a handy dandy discussion session where you can discuss ideas around the PersonaForge Prompt.

## Look - I get it - I'm asking a lot to learn this...

I think getting used to an environment like this will have advantages for all of us.

We will be able to bring the best bits of the programming world to the best bits of communication. 

We are already seeing how a well created super prompt is a powerful tool.

Let's learn from our discoveries and each other.

P.S. Coding friends - If I've committed any horrific “faux pas” (That’s fancy talk for mistakes) in setting up this repository can you let me know and I'll fix them (or beg you to…)
